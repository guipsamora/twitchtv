Hint: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream coding: ["freecodecamp", "storbeck", "terakilobyte", "habathcx","RobotCaleb","thomasballinger","noobs2ninjas","beohoff","brunofin", "comster404"]

User Stories:

User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
      - Get the API working
      - Put online/offline if user is already streaming
      - Make layout
User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
      - Link chanel

User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
      - If online and streaming put the description of the streaming

User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
